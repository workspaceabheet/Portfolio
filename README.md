This is my first ever project on Web Dev. The Website I've created is pretty basic and a simple color scheme was chosen. I've used CSS Grid and Images as tiles for different parts. 

Unique

It's hard to be unique the first time you do something. Nevertheless I've tried. The Skills section is divided into technical and non technical skills. The top right info section has a box shadow feature in the paragraph which maks it look detached. I've used fontwesome icons as links to social media platforms. Not a lot of Unique here.

Problems Faced:
The main problem is the design and to choose what colors go with which. Moreover the grid system sometimes came out as disproportionate. The footer section where the links are was difficult to set up differently and it looks mixed up with the rest of the page. I chose a simple color white and black. The grid problems were resolved by hit and trial.

Scope Of Improvement:
I want to update the color theme to better vibrant colors. I want to use animations and graphs and charts. I want to implement Bootstrap.

What I Learned:
I didn't know a single thing about web design and in the course of 10 days this much was possible. So it's safe to say that I learned a million things. It's a long way to go.
